The target capture sequence raw data as it was sent by RapidGenomics are stored in: 1) **My laptop**, 2) **External HD**, 3) **Albiorix Gothenburg cluster (~/proj/data25)**, and 4) **MetaCentrum Czech national cluster (_NOT YET!_)**.

There are several frontends, or machines, that can be used directly via log in without reservation. I've been using 4 frontends regularly, `skirit.ics.muni.cz` for small analyses such as diversification and biogeography (home directory in _brno2_), `zuphux.cerit-sc.cz` for high memory jobs, up to a few TB of memory (home directory in _brno3-cerit_), `nympha.zcu.cz` for running NGS-related analyses because it has 3 TB space quota for storing (home directory in _plzen1_), and `storage-brno3-cerit.metacentrum.cz` for storing raw NGS data because it doesn't have a space quota (home directory in _brno3-cerit_).
