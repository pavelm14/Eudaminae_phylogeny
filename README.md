# Phylogenomic analysis: From raw data to time-calibrated tree

This is my notebook describing the process of building a phylogeny using target capture and published whole-genome resequencing data. I will use a number of software and packages written in Python, Bash, Perl. The MetaCentrum Czech national cluster provides the computational resources and infrastructure for all the analyses.
