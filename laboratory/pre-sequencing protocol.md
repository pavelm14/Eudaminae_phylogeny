# Wet lab protocols
This notebook is to detail the practices when processing the specimens at the laboratory. The protocols include, specimen storage, DNA isolation, DNA quantification and quality check.

The equipments and facilities were provided by the University of Gothenburg, Department of Biology and Environmental Sciences, via the Antonelli lab, Sweden.

## Specimen storage
Upon arrival of the specimens in Gothenburg, I stored them in the lab fridge (+4&deg; C) to prevent further DNA degradation.

When isolated DNA arrived from Ullasa Kodandaramaiah and Ranjit Sahoo (India), I stored the DNA plates in the lab freezer (&minus;20&deg; C).

## DNA isolation
I sterelized all the tools (pipettes, forceps, racks, pestles) using 70&deg; ethanol and UV sterilization for 30 minutes in the chamber. The working space was sterilized with 10% bleach.

DNA was isolated from two or three legs per specimens. The legs were submerged in 95&deg; ethanol to remove dust and other forms of potential contaminants. Ethanol was placed in strips so that each specimen had its own well for washing.

The legs were then left overnight to evaporate the ethanol at room temperature. I avoid freezing and thawing the sample as much as possible to reduce risk of further DNA damage.

### Usage of DNA extraction kit
1. I used two types of QIAGEN kits, [DNeasy Blood & Tissue](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit/#orderinginformation) for fresh and dried material, and the [QIAamp DNA Micro](https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/pcr/qiaamp-dna-micro-kit/) for old museum specimens.

2. I placed the legs in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and added **180 μL of _Buffer ATL_**. I use pellet pestles (e.g., [Fisherbrand](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fisherbrand-rnase-free-disposable-pellet-pestles-2/p-4246531)'s or [Geneaid](http://www.geneaid.com/products/laboratory-supplies/micropestle)'s) to grind and homogenize the legs with the buffer.

3. I added **25 μL of _Proteinase K_** and mix the solution gently up and down. The incubation of samples happened usually overnight at 56&deg; C (or up to 1.5 days when working with museum specimens), inverting the tubes time to time. During this step, I avoided using the vortex machine to prevent further DNA damage.

4. For the old museum specimens, I diluted the carrier RNA (310 μg) in 310 μL of _Buffer AE_. This solution was then aliquoted and stored in wells (20 μL, with a concentration of 1 μg/μL) at &minus;20&deg;. This is to avoid continuous freezing and thawing of the solution.

5. Add **200 μL of _Buffer AL_** (and **1 μL of _diluted carrier RNA_** in the case of museum specimens). For example, when working with old material, for 6 specimens I prepared a master mix of 1,400 μL of Buffer AL and 7 μL of carrier RNA. Do not vortex the solution to prevent the formation of foam. Incubate the samples at 70&deg; C for 10 minutes. 

6. Following, add **200 μL of _cool absolute ethanol_** and mix thoroughly by pulse-vortexing for 15 seconds. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.

7. Briefly centrifuge the 1.5 mL tubes to remove drops from inside the lid. Use the MiniElute columns from now on. First, **transfer the solution** to the column, then, add **500 μL of _Buffer AW1_** to the column, and finally add **500 μL of _Buffer AW2_** for a final wash of the column.

8. In between the steps above, centrifuge the tubes at 9,000 rpm for 1 minute. In the final wash, centrifuge at full speed (1,400 rpm) for 3 minutes.

9. Continue with a 30-minutes incubation at room temperature with **140 μL of _Elution Buffer AE_**. However, it is preferable to divide the elution step in two instances, each with 70 μL of Buffer AE, and full speed centrifuge for 1 minute.

10. A negative control was simultaneously included during the DNA isolations steps for the museum specimens only. In that way, I double-checked false positives that may have potentially arise from contamination in the lab.

## DNA quality and quantity control
We used up to four approaches to measure DNA quality and quantity. For all samples, I used Qubit fluorometric quantitation and NanoDrop spectrophotometry. For most samples, I evaluated DNA integrity and rough estimation of genomic DNA sizes using electrophoresis. For a handful of samples, I ran TapeStation to accurately screen DNA fragmentation and nucleic acid concentration.

### Electrophoresis: Estimation of DNA fragmentation and concentration
1. Prepare the electrophoresis gel by mixing 100 mL of 1X TAE Buffer, 1 g of agarose, and 1μL of GelRed for DNA staining. Microwave the solution until it becomes transparent. Cool down a bit the agarose mix and place it to the electrophoresis tray, along with the combs that will create the wells for DNA. Wait until the gel solidifies.

2. Mix 3 μL of DNA and 1 μL of Blue Loading Buffer. You can use Parafilm to create drops of the mix, otherwise, use strips and place one sample per well. It is advvisable to load a DNA ladder to get an estimate of DNA fragment sizes and concentrations.

3. Load the DNA mixture to the 1% agarose gel and start the electrophoresis by applying 100 V for 60 minutes.

4. Store the DNA aliquots at &minus;20&deg; C.
