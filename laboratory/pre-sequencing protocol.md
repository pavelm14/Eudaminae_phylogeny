# Wet lab protocols
This notebook is to detail the practices when processing the specimens at the laboratory. The protocols include, specimen storage, DNA isolation, DNA quantification and quality check.

The equipments and facilities were provided by the University of Gothenburg, Department of Biology and Environmental Sciences, via the Antonelli lab, Sweden.

## Specimen storage
Upon arrival of the specimens in Gothenburg, I stored them in the lab fridge (+4&deg;) to prevent further DNA degradation.

When isolated DNA arrived from Ullasa Kodandaramaiah and Ranjit Sahoo (India), I stored the DNA plates in the lab freezer (-20&deg;).

## DNA isolation
